# Reversing-a-String

reversing-a-string The string reversal approach involves switching the characters in a string's sequence so that the final character becomes the first character, and so on. In other words, swapping occurs.

The palindrome can be verified using this concept.


A string that doesn't change when it is reversed is called a palindrome.

Therefore, even after being reversed, a palindrome string will still have the same value.
